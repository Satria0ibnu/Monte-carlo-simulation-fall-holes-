# Monte-carlo-simulation-fall-holes-
Cpp program that count the probability 'panda' will fall in the future given 4 holes around his house

In a given day, if the panda walks randomly around the forest,
what is the probability that it will end up into one of the holes and die

monte carlo, take som unbias data and perform probability calculation

monte carlo simulation predict a set of possible value based on estimated range of value
it recalculates those values over and over again with different values
